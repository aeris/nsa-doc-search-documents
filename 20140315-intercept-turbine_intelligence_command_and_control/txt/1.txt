(TSHSIHREL) TURBINE manages the active implants that make up the Active SIGINT system.
Active SIGINT offers a more aggressive approach to SIGINT.
We retrieve data through intervention in our targets’ computers or network devices. Extract data from machine. This is: Tailored Access Operations!

One of the greatest challenges for Active SIGINT/attack is scale. Human “drivers" limit ability for large-scale exploitation (humans tend to operate within th:
own environment, not taking into account the bigger picture)
The TURBINE infrastructure will allow the current implant network to scale to large size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated
control implants by groups instead of individually.
Expert System (resource and operations manager) is like the brain it manages the applications and functions of implants.

Decides which tools should be provided to a given implant and executes the rules on how it should be used

Decisions of the expert system are passed to the command and control modules, which execute the decision against the appropriate set of implar
Diode is a device that allows connectivity from the high side to the low side network without human intervention.
